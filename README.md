## General Information
Many times you might have seen a cloud filled with lots of words in different sizes, which represent the frequency or the importance of each word. This is called Tag Cloud or WordCloud. *[Source: DataCamp]*  
In this project, we make a WordCloud from the transcript scraped to get an idea of what the speaker talked about.
## Libraries Used
- lxml - version 4.9.1
- beautifulsoup4 - version 4.11.1
- requests - version 2.28.1
- selenium - version 4.5.0
- wordcloud - version 1.8.2.2
- numpy - version 1.23.3
- matplotlib - version 3.6.1


## Improvements
This project is using Selenium for browser automation to click on "Read transcript" button to make the transcript visible for scraping.  
It will click the button and give the modified page to beautifulsoup for scraping.
